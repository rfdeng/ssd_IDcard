# ssd_IDcard
detection of the ID card

my impletation of training/inference scripts are ssd300_training.py and ssd300_inference.py
I also write the scripts to convert the keras .h5 model to .pb model. See the corresponding scripts tmpconvert.py convert2pb.py for details.

the inference code using the .pb model is given in the IDcard service.
